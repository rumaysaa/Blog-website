* Secure
Payroll involves storing some of your employees’ most sensitive information like their personal details, bank information, salary figures, and personal account numbers (PAN). Pick a well-known vendor that takes security seriously so you can safeguard your employee’s data. The vendor should be compliant with the International Security Standards, including a ISO/IEC 27001 security certificate, so you know they follow top-notch protocols.
